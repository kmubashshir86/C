DOUBLE >> FLOAT >> INT

// meaning agar lets say koi bhi airthmetic operation hota hai ( binary operation)
	* homogenous types ke liye

	   int (operation) int = int
	   float (operation) float = float
	   double (operation) double = double


	* hetrogeneous types ke liye

	  int (operation) float = float
	  int (operation) double = double
	  float (operation) double = double
